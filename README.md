# 2048
The 2048 game as played on the web


**How to play**
- You are prompted with a couple of options (WASD), W to move up, A move left, S move down, D move right
- the board will move according to your choice, try to group like numbers together
- the goal is to get 2048 on the board with your combinations


**What I implemented**
- the move_left,right,up,down functions
- the main game loop that asks for user input and renders the board according to the user input
